## Abstract
To meet the demand for higher data capacity,
there is growing interest in frequencies that allow for a larger
bandwidth. One of the frequency band being investigated to
meet this future communication system requirements is the
Terahertz (THz) frequencies, which has yet to be allocated.
However, extended measurement campaigns and comprehensive
propagation channel modeling are essential to understand the
THz spectrum and to develop reliable communication systems
in this band. In this direction, we suggest the utilization of the
hierarchical Dirichlet Process Gamma Mixture Model (DPGMM)
to characterize THz channels statistically in the absence of any
prior knowledge. This DPGMM allows inferring both mixture
component parameters and the required number of components
as well. We also present the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm for Gamma mixture model (GMM). To measure the
difference between these models and the experimental probability
density functions (PDFs), Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-
divergence) is used. We employ these methods on sub-THz band
measurements frequencies between 240 GHz and 300 GHz which
are published online. Thus, by comparing DPGMM and EM
algorithm results in measurement datasets, we illustrate how
well the DPGMM fits the target distribution. It is shown that
the proposed DPGMM can accurately describe the various sub-
THz channels as much as the EM algorithm and its flexibility
allows it to represent more complex distributions better than the
EM algorithm. Furthermore, it is also can be used to characterize
any type of wireless channel.
